## 1. Project Title

**Code Documentation Navigator**
AI-Powered Semantic Search and Documentation System

---

## 2. Abstract

Modern software projects often suffer from poor documentation, making code understanding difficult for developers, students, and maintainers. The **Code Documentation Navigator** solves this problem by using Artificial Intelligence and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to automatically analyze source code and generate human-readable explanations.

The system allows users to upload a ZIP file of any project. It extracts the source code, processes it using semantic embeddings, stores it in a vector database, and enables users to ask natural language questions. The system retrieves the most relevant code sections and generates clear, understandable explanations using a free open-source language model.

This project demonstrates the practical application of AI in software engineering, documentation automation, and developer productivity tools.

## 3. Problem Statement

Developers face the following problems in real-world projects:

* Poor or missing documentation
* Difficulty understanding large codebases
* High onboarding time for new developers
* Manual documentation is time-consuming and error-prone
* Code understanding requires reading many files

There is a need for an **intelligent system** that can:

* Read source code automatically
* Understand code meaning
* Answer questions in natural language
* Generate explanations
* Work without paid APIs
